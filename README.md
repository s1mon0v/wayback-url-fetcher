# Wayback URL Fetcher

**Wayback URL Fetcher** is a simple and powerful bash script that helps you fetch all URLs or specific URLs with certain file extensions from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org). This tool can be useful for scraping historical data or recovering resources from archived websites.

## Features

- Fetch all URLs for a given domain from the Wayback Machine.
- Filter URLs based on specific file extensions such as PDFs, images, documents, and more.
- Save results in two output files:
  - `all_urls.txt`: All archived URLs.
  - `filtered_urls.txt`: URLs that match specific file types.
